# Place the binary 'volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe' into the .\modules\bin folder. And if you want to provide a Volatility profile (such as Win2016x64_14393) or a KDBG, you have to create a file named 'volatilityrc' and place it in the same folder as the Volatility binary. Set the following content in that file:
#
# [DEFAULT]
# PROFILE=Win2016x64_14393
# #KDBG=0x82944c28
