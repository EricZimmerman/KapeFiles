# Documentation
# For those who don't know, VoidTools' Everything is what Windows search wishes it could be. Use it instead of Windows Search. Get it here: https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/
# Everything must have been exited completely in order for the Everything.db file to have been committed to disk. So for initial installs, it won't commit until the first exit.
# Everything creates a searchable index almost instantly on any system its installed on. Everything.db is what this index is stored in.
# This target pulls the Everything.db which can then be converted with the Everything (VoidTools) Module to provide a readable list of every file located on a system using a text editor or the Everything tool itself.
# The Search History and Run History are not enabled by default. They can be enabled within Options -> History.
# Timestamps within the CSV files can be converted with CyberChef with this particular recipe: https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_UNIX_Timestamp('Nanoseconds%20(ns)')
